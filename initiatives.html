    ">Colors of Freedom – a painting drive to spread awareness that Every Child is Special</span></h2>
          <p class="lead" style="  font-size: 14px;
    font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif; color: black;">Denying children with disabilities their right to education had a lifelong impact on learning, achievement and employment opportunities, thereby hindering their potential economic, social and human development.
As per the UN report, ‘Out of 2.9 million children with disabilities in India, 990,000 children aged 6 to 14 years (34 percent) are out of school. The percentages are even higher among children with intellectual disabilities (48 percent), speech impairments (36 percent) and multiple disabilities (59 percent).’
To coincide with the 70th Independence Day celebrations, National CSR Network (NCN), Awesomesauce (a PR agency) and Saarthak Educational Society organized a Children’s Painting Drive on the theme “COLORS OF FREEDEOM” that was held on August 13, 2016 in New Delhi to create sensitization through social media and other social handles that being differently abled just posed a challenge, it did not deny capability of an individual.  The experiences/ideas shared by children in the form of paintings depicted what freedom meant to them.  It helped us to look at freedom from a different lens and spend some time with the amazingly cute children at Sarthak Educational Trust. 
We hope to reach out to the companies to help them live their dream. We can't help everyone but we believe everyone can help someone to make world a better place.</p>
